# Is the JDBC template able to participate in an existing transaction?
Yes, JDBC Template is able to participate in existing transaction. It will support both, transaction created 
with ```@Transactional``` annotation and also programmatically created transaction.

JDBC Template is able to participate in existing transaction by usage of ```DataSourceUtils``` and ```TransactionSynchronizationManager```.
```TransactionInterceptor``` and ```TransactionAspectSupport``` are also using ```PlatformTransactionManager``` together with
```DataSourceTransactionManager``` which will set transaction in ```TransactionSynchronizationManager``` for JDBC Template
(or other components) to reuse.
