# Which PlatformTransactionManager(s) can you use with JPA?
JPA can work with following transaction managers:
- ```JpaTransactionManager``` - recommended when working with one database and one Entity Manager
- ```JtaTransactionManager``` - recommended when working with multiple databases and Entity Managers, or when working with 
multiple databases and other transactional resources, for example one transaction needs to span Database and JMS Topic
  
Usage of ```JpaTransactionManager``` in case of multiple Databases / Transactional Resources / Entity Managers will cause 
each transaction, span only one resource, this is why ```JtaTransactionManager``` is required in this case.
