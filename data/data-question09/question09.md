# Is a transaction a cross-cutting concern? How is implemented by Spring?
Transaction is a cross-cutting concern and in Spring it is implemented with usage of ```@Transactional``` annotation.

If ```@Transactional``` annotation is present on top of the method or entire class, then each call to the method in the class
will be proxied by ```TransactionInterceptor``` and ```TransactionAspectSupport``` classes. Those classes will interact 
with ```PlatformTransactionManager``` to commit transaction upon successful method execution or rollback upon exception.

Exact behaviour will be dependent on transaction propagation and isolation level settings, which can be set in ```@Transactional```
annotation.
