# What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?

- Simplifies deployment, by allowing to create executable ```jar``` and also supports traditional deployment on top of 
application server
- Provides automatic configuration which reduces boilerplate configuration, and allows easy customization when defaults 
are not sufficient
- Allows for Dev / Prod parity
- Provides set of managed dependencies
- Provides Maven plugin
- Provides non-functional features common for projects - externalized configuration, security, metrics, health checks
- Integrates with Micro Service Architecture Tools for building Highly Available and Fault Tolerant Applications - Eureka,
Ribbon, OpenFeign
- Integrates with ```systemd``` and ```init.d``` which allows to easily run applications as Linux services
