# What is a patter? What is an anti pattern ? Is dependency injection a patter ?
A design patter is a reusable solution to common occurring problems in software design.

Some examples of design pattern from the GoF:
- Factory Method
- **Builder** (with code example)
- Template Method
- Strategy 
- Observer
- Facade
- Composite
- ...

Indeed, Dependency Injection is a pattern that solves problems of flexible dependency creation.
