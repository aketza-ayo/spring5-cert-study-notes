# What does the @Bean annotation do?
```@Bean``` annotation is used in ```@Configuration``` class to inform Spring that instance of a class returned by method
annotated with ```@Bean``` will return a bean that will be managed by Spring.

```@Bean``` also allows you to: 
- Specify init method - will be called after instance is created and assembled
- Specify destroy method - will be called bean is discarded (usually when context is closed)
- Specify the name for the bean - by default bean has the name autogenerated based on method name, however this can be overridden
- Specify alias/aliases for the bean
- Specify if bean should be used as candidate for injection into other beans - default true
- Configure Autowiring mode - by name or type (Deprecated since Spring 5.1)
