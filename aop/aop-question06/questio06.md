# What do you have to do to enable the detection of the @Aspect annotation? What does @EnableAspectJAutoProxy do?
To enable detection of @Aspect annotation you need to :
- Have @Configuration class with @EnableAspectJAutoProxy
    - Without @EnableAspectJAutoProxy Spring will not scan for @Aspect
    
- Have beans for @Aspect annotated classes created
    - Use @ComponentScan with @Component at class annotated with @Aspect
    - Use @Bean in Configuration class and create Spring Aspect Bean manually
    
- Have ```aspectjweaver/spring-aop``` on classpath 
    - It is easiest to use ```org.springframework::spring-aspects``` dependency to have those included 
    - Without required dependencies on classpath spring will fail with ```ClassNotFoundException/NoClassDefFoundError```
    during creation of Proxy objects for Spring Bean subject to aspects
      
# What does enable @EnableAspectJAutoProxy do?
Annotation ```@EnableAspectJAutoProxy``` enables detection of @Aspect classes and creates proxy object for beans subject
to aspects. Internally process of creating proxies is done by ```AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator```. By creating 
a proxy for each bean subject to aspects, spring intercepts the calls and implements Before / After / AfterReturning / AfterThrowing / Around
advices. It is important to remember that ```@Aspect``` will not create Spring Beans on it's own, you need to use Component
Scanning or manually create beans for ```@Aspect``` classes
